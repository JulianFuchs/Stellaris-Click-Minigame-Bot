# Stellaris-Click-Minigame-Bot
Bot for the Stellaris click game, Version 1.0

Download the bot from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/stellaris-click-game-bot/

How to use the bot:

(You need Firefox and .NET to run the bot!)

- Download the zip file and extract the folder "Stellaris Click Game Bot"

- In the folder, start the "StellarisClickGameBot.exe"

- Select which mode you want to run: "clicks only mode" or "default mode". 

In default mode, debris and blueprints will get collected with a success rate of about 60% and the bot performs about 500 clicks per minute (on a very good machine, results may vary).

In "clicks only mode", (to everyone's surprise), the bot only clicks and does not search for blueprints or debris. If you have a slower machine, it's probably better if you run this mode.

- Choose if you want to enter your login manually or enter it in the options menu. If you enter your login into the bot, it will do everything for you. If you want to manually enter your login, you must wait until you come to the paradox page where you have to provide your login. Enter your login and press "sign in". After you pressed sign in, go back to the bot and click the orange button. Then click nothing anymore and just wait! The bot will do the rest. 

- Run the bot!

And help get the sweet platypus thingy!
